    it's probably some code I needed to customize for the adaptation.

    Creates a wrapper that supports saving and loading environemnt states.
    Required for planning algorithms.

    This class will have access to the core environment as self.env, e.g.:
    - self.env.reset()           #reset original env
    - self.env.ale.cloneState()  #make snapshot for atari. load with .restoreState()
    - ...

    You can also use reset, step and render directly for convenience.

        Warning! Snapshots can be arbitrary things (strings, integers, json, tuples)
        Don't count on them being pickle strings when implementing MCTS.
        
        Developer Note: Make sure the object you return will not be affected by 
        anything that happens to the environment after it's saved.
        You shouldn't, for example, return self.env. 
        In case of doubt, use pickle.dumps or deepcopy.
